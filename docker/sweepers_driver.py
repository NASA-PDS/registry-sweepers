# Python driver for provenance
# ============================
#
# This script is provided to support the scheduled execution of PDS Registry
# Provenance, typically in AWS via Event Bridge and ECS/Fargate.
#
# This script makes the following assumptions for its run-time:
#
# - The EN (i.e. primary) OpenSearch endpoint is provided in the environment
#   variable PROV_ENDPOINT
# - The username/password is provided as a JSON key/value in the environment
#   variable PROV_CREDENTIALS
# - The remotes available through cross cluster search to be processed are
#   provided as a JSON list of strings - each string containing the space
#   separated list of remotes (as they appear on the provenance command line)
#   Each set of remotes is used in an execution of provenance. The value of
#   this is specified in the environment variable PROV_REMOTES. If this
#   variable is empty or not defined, provenance is run without specifying
#   remotes and only the PROV_ENDPOINT is processed.
# - The directory containing the provenance.py file is in PATH and is
#   executable.
#
