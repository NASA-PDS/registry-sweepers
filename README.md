# Registry Sweepers

This module enable to sweep the PDS Registries by:

- adding the superseded_by property on the non latest products
- adding ancestry to the products


## Prerequisites

python 3.9

## User Quickstart

Install with:

    pip install registry-sweeper

To execute, run:

    python src/pds/registrysweepers/provenance.py --help

Ancestry utility cannot be called from a command line script but is called in `https://github.com/NASA-PDS/registry-sweepers/blob/main/docker/sweepers_driver.py` used in a docker image.


## Code of Conduct

All users and developers of the NASA-PDS software are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please read this to ensure you understand the expectations of our community.


## Development

To develop this project, use your favorite text editor, or an integrated development environment with Python support, such as [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).


### Contributing

For information on how to contribute to NASA-PDS codebases please take a look at our [Contributing guidelines](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).


### Installation

Install in editable mode and with extra developer dependencies into your virtual environment of choice:

    pip install --editable '.[dev]'

Configure the `pre-commit` hooks:

    pre-commit install
    pre-commit install -t pre-push
    pre-commit install -t prepare-commit-msg
    pre-commit install -t commit-msg

These hooks check code formatting and also aborts commits that contain secrets such as passwords or API keys. However, a one time setup is required in your global Git configuration. See [the wiki entry on Git Secrets](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/nasa-pds.github.io/wiki/Git-and-Github-Guide#git-secrets) to learn how.

### Packaging

To isolate and be able to re-produce the environment for this package, you should use a [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html). To do so, run:

    python -m venv venv

Then exclusively use `venv/bin/python`, `venv/bin/pip`, etc.

If you have `tox` installed and would like it to create your environment and install dependencies for you run:

    tox --devenv <name you'd like for env> -e dev

Dependencies for development are specified as the `dev` `extras_require` in `setup.cfg`; they are installed into the virtual environment as follows:

    pip install --editable '.[dev]'

All the source code is in a sub-directory under `src`.


### Tests

This section describes testing for your package.

A complete "build" including test execution, linting (`mypy`, `black`, `flake8`, etc.), and documentation build is executed via:

    tox


#### Unit tests

Your project should have built-in unit tests, functional, validation, acceptance, etc., tests.

For unit testing, check out the [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) module, built into Python 3.

Tests objects should be in packages `test` modules or preferably in project 'tests' directory which mirrors the project package structure.

Our unit tests are launched with command:

    pytest

If you want your tests to run automatically as you make changes start up `pytest` in watch mode with:

    ptw


## Build

    pip install wheel
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel


## Publication

NASA PDS packages can publish automatically using the [Roundup Action](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/roundup-action), which leverages GitHub Actions to perform automated continuous integration and continuous delivery. A default workflow that includes the Roundup is provided in the `.github/workflows/unstable-cicd.yaml` file. (Unstable here means an interim release.)


### Manual Publication

Create the package:

    python setup.py bdist_wheel

Publish it as a Github release.

Publish on PyPI (you need a PyPI account and configure `$HOME/.pypirc`):

    pip install twine
    twine upload dist/*

Or publish on the Test PyPI (you need a Test PyPI account and configure `$HOME/.pypirc`):

    pip install twine
    twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

## CI/CD

The template repository comes with our two "standard" CI/CD workflows, `stable-cicd` and `unstable-cicd`. The unstable build runs on any push to `main` (Â± ignoring changes to specific files) and the stable build runs on push of a release branch of the form `release/<release version>`. Both of these make use of our GitHub actions build step, [Roundup](https://github.com/NASA-PDS/roundup-action). The `unstable-cicd` will generate (and constantly update) a SNAPSHOT release. If you haven't done a formal software release you will end up with a `v0.0.0-SNAPSHOT` release (see NASA-PDS/roundup-action#56 for specifics).
